        I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave 
        reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he 
        scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!

        This rich and creamy fettuccine Alfredo is an easy recipe even for beginner 
        cooks, but it's impressive enough for company.
